I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology at Xi'an Jiaotong University, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Li Bo](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/boblee/2). My academic focus centers on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing. I previously earned my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Yunnan University, where I was mentored by  [Prof. Dr. Xie Cheng](http://www.sei.ynu.edu.cn/info/1023/1166.htm).<br/>

My academic work has been driven by a passion for pushing the boundaries of AI and its applications. From exploring Recommender Systems to working on NLP projects, I have consistently sought to contribute to advancements in the field. My interest in NLP has also led me to dive deep into the evolution of language models and their applications in real-world scenarios.<br/>

Beginning in September 2025, I will be pursuing a 'PhD in Intelligent Robotics' under the supervision of [Professor Zhang Xiaodong](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/amct).



### I’m a pretty chill person, enjoying my time in China. ENTJ-A
### I’m really into sports—
- sometimes I practice **Boxing and Jujutsu**, play **Badminton** with my labmates, **snooker** with seniors, and **Tennis** with friends. Every sunday I go to **swim** on my own. **Rowing** is something I love to compete in, and on Sports Day, our department team won the championship and my team got **Third** place. Oh, I forgot to mention that I have completed two **Marathon** at XJTU hhhh and try to run regularly. For me I’d much rather be active than play computer games. (something totally opposite for a CS students 哈哈）

### Also I do volunteer work a lot, aa lott， as a Minister in Student Union I try to make student life easier by helping them. 
- I’ve put together a bunch of activities to promote culture, sports, and academics. 
- Right now, I’m busy welcoming new students (graduate, undergrad, medical, and language) across four campuses. I really enjoy doing this-it keeps me busy and active.
