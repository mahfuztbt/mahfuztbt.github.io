Master’s student in Computer Science and Technology at Xi'an Jiaotong University, supervised by [Prof. Dr. Li Bo](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/boblee/2), with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Yunnan University under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Xie Cheng](http://www.sei.ynu.edu.cn/info/1023/1166.htm).<br/>

My academic work has been driven by a passion for pushing the boundaries of AI and its applications. From exploring Recommender Systems to working on NLP projects, I have consistently sought to contribute to advancements in the field. My interest in NLP has also led me to dive deep into the evolution of language models and their applications in real-world scenarios.<br/>

During my time as an Academic Tutor and Teaching Assistant at Xi'an Jiaotong University, I’ve had the privilege of mentoring fellow students, which has deepened my understanding of the subject matter and strengthened my commitment to research and education.<br/>

As I pursue a PhD, my goal is to engage in research that not only advances the state of the art in AI, ML, DL, and NLP but also addresses pressing challenges and creates tangible benefits for society.

# Work Experience

**Physics Wallah**  
*Data Science Intern*  
**Sept 2022 - March 2023**  
As a Data Science Intern at Physics Wallah, I analyzed large datasets, developed machine learning models, and created data visualizations to support decision-making. I collaborated with teams to deliver data-driven solutions and performed data cleaning and preprocessing for analysis.

**Yunnan University**  
*ML Intern*  
**Oct 2021 - April 2022**  
During my internship with Prof. Dr. XieCheng, I worked on a Deep Learning project, enhancing my skills and understanding in this field. I documented new concepts, received valuable feedback, and identified areas for improvement. This experience boosted my technical abilities and strengthened my passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

**Teaching Assistant**  
**March 2021 - Jan 2022**  
As a teaching assistant at Yunnan University for the "Database System Design & Software Engineering" course, I led review sessions, graded assignments, and guided students. This experience enhanced my communication skills, deepened my understanding of the material, and provided valuable classroom management experience.


# Projects 

**Pneumonia Detection**  
A machine learning project using CNN. In this experiment first I use CNN to build a model and create model class then do this experiment I use VGG-16 and ResNet-50 with the dataset from “Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center” dataset consists of around 5000 and 600 images in the training and testing set respectively and the accuracy was for VGG-16 91.35% while Resnet-50 network model got an accuracy of 88.00%.

**Movie Recommendation System**  
Developed a comprehensive movie recommendation system that allows users to search for movies, view detailed information, and rate them. The system analyzes user ratings to assess the quality of movies (good or bad) and provides personalized movie recommendations based on individual user preferences and past ratings.

**Movie Recommendation System**  
In this system have three roles-Admin, teacher and students. Each of them has different permission, like select-withdraw course, create course-class, scoring etc. a complete course selection system with JavaScript.

**E-store**  
A fully functional online shopping store using Django. The platform includes secure user authentication, a dynamic product catalog, shopping cart, and a seamless checkout process with payment integration. Users can manage their orders and view order history. An admin dashboard allows for efficient management of products, orders, and users. The store features a review and rating system, responsive design for mobile devices.
